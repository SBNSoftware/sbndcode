### HEY!!!
### Broken configurations do not belong to the primary `fcl` directory tree.
### Fix them; or remove them; or if they are unfixable but have a historical
### value, move them to an `archive` directory.

# transitional: configurations that were broken when this test was introduced;
# these should be fixed/removed/archived, but if we wait for that to happen
# for all of them before we enable the test, it will just never happen.
# This should at least allow the issues not to grow.
