#
# File:    standard_g4_sbnd.fcl
# Purpose: Propagation of generated particle through matter (Geant4 simulation)
# Version: 1.2
# 
# This configuration runs:
# - LArG4: produces:
#   * MCParticle's (particles produced by interaction with matter)
#   * SimChannels (charge and energy deposited by each particle reaching
#       each TPC readout channel)
#   * SimPhotons (photons reaching each optical readout channel)
# - MCReco: produces:
#   * MCTrack, MCShower: deposited energy from each MCParticle
# 
# Input: a file with generated particles; all MCTruth data products in the input
#        file are processed.
# 
# Dependencies:
# - uses the bundle of SBND simulation services
# - will require flux files for Genie and Corsika
#
# Changes:
# 20160707 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.1]
#   - uniformed to prodsingle_sbnd.fcl
#
# 20161223 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.2]
#   - adopted shared root output configuration
