This directory contains PMT trigger specific modules. To simulate the trigger hardware and software trigger, run the modules in this order: 

1. hardware trigger
2. artdaq fragment producer
3. software trigger producer 

The software trigger is configurable, meaning the various algorithms can be turned on and off in the fcl file.
