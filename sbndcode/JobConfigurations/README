The intended operation of the fcl workflows is that the `standard-*` fcls run the standard workflow. This isn't currently true and should be acknowledged here. Diversions due to space charge effect workflows and the implentation of the 2D drift simulation & signal processing (WireCell) have resulted in an explosion in the number of fcls and a confusing naming system.

At the time of writing, the core workflow (for BNB + Dirt + Cosmics) is the following:
- prodoverlay_corsika_cosmics_proton_genie_rockbox_sce.fcl
- g4_sce_dirt_filter_lite_wc.fcl
- wirecell_sim_sp_sbnd.fcl
- detsim_sce_lite_wc.fcl
- reco1_sce_lite_wc2d.fcl
- reco2_sce.fcl

This may well change over the coming months, and this README should be updated to reflect this.

* ALERT * 
Due to changes implemented in sbndcode PRs #408 and #409 the 1D simulation fcls will not work out of the box, they will need editing by experts!
Hopefully this is a relatively temporary state of affairs!
