# File:    prodsingle_sbnd_withcaldata.fcl
# Purpose: Produce single muon events including full SBND detector simulation
#          and calibration data
# Version: 1.1
# 
# This configuration runs event generation, simulation of propagation through
# matter, readout simulation and signal processing (the first reconstruction
# step).
# 
# Input: no input file required
# 
# Dependencies:
# - uses prodsingle_sbnd.fcl as baseline
#
# Changes:
# 20160601 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.1]
#   - rewritten to be based on prodsingle_sbnd.fcl
#

# configure the additional module we want to call:
physics.producers.caldata: @local::sbnd_calwire

# ... and add it to the standard path

physics.simulate: [ rns, generator, largeant, daq, caldata ] 

#
# at the end of the configuration, we can override single parameters to reflect our needs:
