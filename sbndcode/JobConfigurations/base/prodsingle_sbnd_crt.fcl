# File:    prodsingle_sbnd_crt.fcl
# Purpose: Produce single muon events in full SBND detector simulation with CRTs
# Version: 1.0
# 
# This configuration runs event generation, simulation of propagation through
# matter and readout simulation.
# 
# Input: no input file required
# 
# Dependencies:
# - uses the bundle of SBND simulation services including CRT
#
# Changes:
# 20170202 (mastbaum@uchicago.edu)
#   - Initial version
