# File:    prodgenie_roeckbox sbnd.fcl
# Purpose: Produce GENIE events in the SBND detector and surrounding dirt with spill structure
#          using rockbox functionality in GENIEHelper
# Version: 1.1
#
# This configuration runs event generation and largenat
#
# Input: no input file required
#
# Dependencies:
# - uses the bundle of SBND simulation services
