Most of the 'standard' fcls are currently out of date.  Only standard_reco1_sbnd.fcl is currently up to date.
The gen directory contains the various production generator-level fcls for producing different samples
The g4, detsim, reco and anatree directories contain override fcls that tweak parameters/features of the simulation/reconstruction e.g. changing the electron lifetime in the g4 simulation.
The workshop directory contains fcls from a past workshop that probably should have been organised elsewhere ;)
The deprecated directory contains fcls that are being retired and no longer recommended.  They should not be used.
