# File:    standard_detsim_sbnd.fcl
# Purpose: Simulates readout response to induced and collected charge
# Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@fnal.gov)
# Date:    December 23, 2016
# Version: 1.1
# 
# This configuration runs event generation, simulation of propagation through
# matter and readout simulation.
# 
# Input:
# - output from LArG4 module (in particular, SimChannels)
# 
# Output:
# - daq: RawDigit collection with simulated TPC readout response as waveforms
# - includes the whole input data
# 
# 
# Dependencies:
# - uses the bundle of SBND simulation services for readout simulation
#
# Changes:
# 20160601 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.0]
#   first version
#
# 20161223 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.1]
#   - adopted shared root output configuration
