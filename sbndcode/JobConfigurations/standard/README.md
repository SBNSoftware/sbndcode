# SBND FHiCL Files

The `gen` directory contains the various production generator-level fcls for producing different samples.

The `g4`, `detsim`, `reco` and `anatree` directories contain override fcls that tweak parameters/features of the simulation/reconstruction e.g. changing the electron lifetime in the g4 simulation.

The `workshop` directory contains fcls from a past workshop that probably should have been organised elsewhere ;)

The `deprecated` directory contains fcls that are being retired and no longer recommended. They should not be used.
