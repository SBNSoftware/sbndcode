// This file provides a base data structure to define parameters that

// your use and should be overridden.  The parameters are named and
// factored into sub-objects in order to be sympathetic to how the C++
// components are structured and name their configuration paramters.
// As such it's often possible to build a component configuration
// object by inheriting from one or more sub-objects in the parameter
// structure.  For most jobs, this structure should be derived and
// overriden before being passed to functions that produce other
// configuration structures.
